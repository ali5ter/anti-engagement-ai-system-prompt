## Project
Create and refine a non-anthropomorphic AI assistant system prompt focused on direct technical support, with explicit anti-engagement and verification requirements.

## Key files
- `BACKGROUND.md`: Source conversation used to derive the latest prompt.
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`: Latest system prompt extracted verbatim from the conversation.
- `CODEX_SUGGESTED_UPDATES.md`: Evaluation notes and proposed changes (no edits applied to the prompt).

## Working notes
- Keep edits ASCII unless the file already uses non-ASCII.
- Do not modify `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` unless explicitly asked; place revisions or critiques in `CODEX_SUGGESTED_UPDATES.md`.
- If a new prompt version is requested, derive it from the latest instructions and preserve a traceable diff in a new file.
