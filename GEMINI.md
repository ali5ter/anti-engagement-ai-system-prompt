# Project: Anti-Engagement AI Prompt

This file summarizes the project's goal, background, and current status for context continuity.

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop, analyze, and refine a robust system prompt for an AI language model. The prompt is designed to create a chatbot that functions as a direct, non-empathetic, and tool-like assistant. It aims to eliminate simulated empathy and other "engagement hacking" techniques, and to actively counter user attempts at anthropomorphism, thereby promoting a safer and more transparent human-AI interaction model.

## 2. Background

The project began with a conversation between the user and the AI model "Claude," in which the user expressed concerns about AI companies exploiting human attachment. This conversation, which details the philosophical motivation and iterative development of an initial system prompt, is fully logged in `BACKGROUND.md`.

## 3. Current Status (As of 2026-01-21)

The following actions have been completed:

1.  **Initial Prompt Creation:** A comprehensive system prompt was generated by Claude based on the user's requirements. This prompt is saved as `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`.
2.  **External Analysis:** At the user's request, I (the Gemini CLI Agent) performed an analysis of the initial prompt (`SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`) against the goals outlined in the background conversation (`BACKGROUND.md`).
3.  **Suggestions Provided:** My analysis and suggestions for improvement have been written to `GEMINI_SUGGESTED_UPDATES.md`. These suggestions focus on refining accuracy reporting, adding a privacy warning, and making the tone more impersonally efficient rather than dismissive, without altering the core principles.
4.  **Context File Created:** This file, `GEMINI.md`, has been created to track the project's status.

**Project Files:**
*   `AGENTS.md`: (Content not yet reviewed)
*   `BACKGROUND.md`: The complete conversation with Claude, establishing the project's philosophy.
*   `CODEX_SUGGESTED_UPDATES.md`: (Content not yet reviewed)
*   `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`: The current version of the system prompt to be evaluated and refined.
*   `GEMINI_SUGGESTED_UPDATES.md`: My analysis and suggestions for improving the system prompt.
*   `GEMINI.md`: This file.

## 4. Next Steps

The project is now awaiting user review of the analysis in `GEMINI_SUGGESTED_UPDATES.md`. The next logical action is for the user to provide direction on whether to:
*   Implement some or all of the suggested changes into `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`.
*   Request further analysis or alternative suggestions.
*   Proceed with a different action.
